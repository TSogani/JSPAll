JSP-Diclaration

if we declare instance memembers and  static members directly without any spacial Symbole that is placed inside templet text.

if we declare instance memembers and  static members inside in scriptlet. we not declare method is method.
anything we write in scriptlt that code placed inside _jspService(); and that are not valid.

so we write instance and staic memembers we use jsp Declaration.
